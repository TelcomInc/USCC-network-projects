# Cloudflare Migration and Product Plan

## Immediate Move From GitHub Pages

The current repo can deploy to Cloudflare Pages as a static site.

- Framework preset: None.
- Build command: blank.
- Build output directory: `/` in the dashboard, or `.` in `wrangler.toml`.
- Production branch: `main`.
- Protect with Cloudflare Access before sharing with clients.

## What Was Corrected

- Removed hardcoded client-side credentials.
- Removed the older duplicate HTML file that exposed credentials.
- Reworked the portal toward the actual closeout workflow:
  - project intake,
  - device-list import,
  - client-selected columns,
  - plan upload preview,
  - automatic symbol placement review queue,
  - AS BUILT packet manifest export.
- Added Cloudflare Pages security headers.
- Added a Cloudflare Pages `wrangler.toml`.

## Required Production Backend

The full product should not store client data only in browser `localStorage`. Use durable services:

| Product Need | Recommended Service |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | Cloudflare Pages |
| Authentication | Cloudflare Access |
| API | Cloudflare Workers |
| Project/device records | Cloudflare D1 or external SQL |
| Plans, workbooks, warranties, cable tests, packets | Cloudflare R2 |
| Long-running document/CV work | Cloudflare Queues plus a processing worker/service |

## Device Data Model

Keep the original uploaded columns, then map selected fields onto standard keys:

- device number,
- device name,
- device type,
- brand,
- product name,
- model number,
- serial number,
- MAC address,
- IP address,
- closet location,
- port location,
- installed location,
- cable test result,
- warranty fields,
- custom client fields.

Not every client list will contain every column. The UI should store a per-template field map instead of forcing a single spreadsheet shape.

## Automatic Plan Symbol Placement

The automatic feature should be built as an approval workflow:

1. Upload plan sheets and legend pages.
2. Rasterize PDFs into page images.
3. Detect legend symbols and labels with OCR/computer vision.
4. Match device types from the workbook/database to legend symbols.
5. Suggest device marker locations from plan annotations, room labels, coordinates, or user-provided click points.
6. Store each marker with confidence, source evidence, approver, and timestamp.
7. Require human review before a marker becomes part of the final AS BUILT packet.

This keeps automation useful without letting a model silently create incorrect record drawings.

## AS BUILT Packet Sections

Recommended default packet:

- Cover page,
- index/table of contents,
- project summary,
- equipment overview,
- device schedule,
- marked AS BUILT layouts,
- data cable test results,
- warranty information,
- photos/field notes,
- appendix/source files.

## Custom Domains

For an apex domain such as `example.com`, the domain should be added as a Cloudflare zone and use Cloudflare nameservers.

For a subdomain such as `client.example.com`, Cloudflare Pages can use a CNAME pointed to the Pages hostname. If the domain is already in your Cloudflare account, the app can later automate this through Cloudflare's DNS and Pages APIs.

Buying brand-new client domains is possible through Cloudflare Registrar, but it requires registrant contact, billing, and ICANN verification flows. Keep domain purchase in the dashboard until the business process is settled.
